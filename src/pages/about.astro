    Welcome to <strong>The Null Hypothesis</strong> — a space where decades of code meet moments of clarity. 
    I'm Kumak, a software engineer with a passion for exploring the deeper patterns that emerge when 
    technology meets human understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>The Journey</h2>
  <p>
    My path through the digital realm has taken me from the early days of web development through 
    the modern landscape of distributed systems, functional programming, and architectural design. 
    Each project has been a lesson in both technical craft and the art of solving human problems 
    through code.
  </p>

  <h2>Philosophy</h2>
  <p>
    I believe in the power of <strong>simplicity over complexity</strong>, elegant solutions over 
    clever hacks, and systems that grow gracefully rather than collapse under their own weight. 
    The null hypothesis reminds us to question our assumptions, strip away the unnecessary, and 
    focus on what truly matters.

  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
  <p>
    This blog explores the intersection of software engineering, system design, and the philosophical 
    questions that emerge when we build digital worlds. Topics range from practical programming 
    patterns to architectural decisions, from debugging methodologies to the broader implications 
    of the systems we create.
  </p>

  <h2>Connect</h2>
  <p>
    The conversation doesn't end with the code. Whether you're debugging a complex system, 
    architecting a new solution, or simply curious about the patterns that emerge in our 
    digital world, I'd love to hear from you.
