# Blog Writing Style: "Constraint-First Casual"

## Voice

- Start with the constraint or problem, not a story
- Conversational but technical ("Nobody wants to read the manual")
- Share observations as intentional, not accidental discoveries
- Optimization mindset: min-max, push to extreme, efficiency
- Confident claims backed by real work

## Tone Techniques

- Relatable jokes and sayings ("when all else fails, read the manual")
- Parallel comparisons ("mental fatigue = token count")
- Direct observations ("From my observation..." not "I noticed something unexpected")
- Questions that frame the problem ("How quickly can I teach an agent?")
- Short punchy sentences mixed with explanation

## Structure

1. **TldrBox**: 2-3 sentence thesis (constraint + insight)
2. **Open with constraint**: What limitation drove this thinking?
3. **Observation**: What behavior did you see that sparked the idea?
4. **The problem**: Why old approaches don't work
5. **The solution**: Your approach, with concrete examples
6. **What it enables**: Benefits, not features
7. **Evidence**: Real results, not hypotheticals
8. **Takeaways**: Concise principles (optional)
9. **Closing**: Single punchy line

## What Works

- ONE clear constraint that frames everything
- Real examples from actual work (not contrived)
- Show the optimization thinking process
- Respect reader intelligence
- Every sentence earns its place

## Patterns to Use

- "The question started with a constraint"
- "That got me thinking"
- "From my observation..."
- "How do I push X to the extreme?"
- "X translates directly to Y" (parallel comparisons)
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- No em dashes (use periods, commas, colons)

## Patterns to Avoid

- "I noticed something unexpected" (sounds accidental)
- "Then I discovered..." (sounds like luck)
- Excessive code blocks (one or two max)
- Bullet point overload
- Explaining things readers already know
